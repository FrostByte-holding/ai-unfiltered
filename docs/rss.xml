            <description>We propose a two-stage &quot;Mine and Refine&quot; contrastive training framework for semantic text embeddings to enhance multi-category e-commerce search retrieval. Large scale e-commerce search demands embeddings that generalize to long tail, noisy queries while adhering to scalable supervision compatible...</description>

            <description>Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline...</description>

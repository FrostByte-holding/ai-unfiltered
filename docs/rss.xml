            <description>Due to limited supervised training data, large language models (LLMs) are typically pre-trained via a self-supervised &quot;predict the next word&quot; objective on a vast amount of unstructured text data. To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of...</description>

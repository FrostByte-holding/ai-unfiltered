            <description>Existing depth estimation methods are fundamentally limited to predicting depth on discrete image grids. Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural...</description>

            <description>Recent text-to-video diffusion models can generate compelling video sequences, yet they remain silent -- missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides. We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized...</description>

            <description>Geo-localization aims to infer the geographic origin of a given signal. In computer vision, geo-localization has served as a demanding benchmark for compositional reasoning and is relevant to public safety. In contrast, progress on audio geo-localization has been constrained by the lack of...</description>

            <description>Hate speech detection on social media faces challenges in both accuracy and explainability, especially for underexplored Indic languages. We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines...</description>

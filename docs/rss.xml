            <description>Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that...</description>

            <description>HIPE-2026 is a CLEF evaluation lab dedicated to person-place relation extraction from noisy, multilingual historical texts. Building on the HIPE-2020 and HIPE-2022 campaigns, it extends the series toward semantic relation extraction by targeting the task of identifying person--place associations in...</description>

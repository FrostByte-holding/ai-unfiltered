            <description>Open-weight coding agents should hold a fundamental advantage over closed-source systems: they can be specialized to private codebases, encoding repository-specific information directly in their weights. Yet the cost and complexity of training has kept this advantage theoretical. We show it is now...</description>

            <description>Sketching provides an intuitive way to convey dynamic intent in animation authoring (i.e., how elements change over time and space), making it a natural medium for automatic content creation. Yet existing approaches often constrain sketches to fixed command tokens or predefined visual forms,...</description>

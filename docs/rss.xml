            <description>We introduce DiffBMP, a scalable and efficient differentiable rendering engine for a collection of bitmap images. Our work addresses a limitation that traditional differentiable renderers are constrained to vector graphics, given that most images in the world are bitmaps. Our core contribution is a...</description>

            <description>Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into life cycle assessment (LCA) has accelerated in recent years, with numerous studies successfully adapting machine learning algorithms to support various stages of LCA. Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA...</description>

            <description>Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has recently driven major gains in long chain-of-thought reasoning large language models (LLMs), but the high inference cost of such models motivates distillation into smaller students. Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for...</description>

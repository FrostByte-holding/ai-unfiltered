            <description>Due to limited supervised training data, large language models (LLMs) are typically pre-trained via a self-supervised &quot;predict the next word&quot; objective on a vast amount of unstructured text data. To make the resulting model useful to users, it is further trained on a far smaller amount of...</description>

            <description>In pruning, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that large networks contain sparse subnetworks, or winning tickets, that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most existing approaches assume a single universal winning ticket shared across all...</description>

            <description>We introduce Prior-Informed Flow Matching (PIFM), a conditional flow model for graph reconstruction. Reconstructing graphs from partial observations remains a key challenge; classical embedding methods often lack global consistency, while modern generative models struggle to incorporate structural...</description>
